Write a function solution(area) that tasks as its input a single unit of measure representing the total area of solar panels you have (between 1 and 1000000 inclusive)
and returns a list of the areas of the largest squares you could make out of those panels, starting with the largest squares first.
So, following the example above, solution(12) would return [9,1,1,1].

Languages:-
To provide a python solution, edit solution.py
To provide a Java solution, edit solution.java

Test Cases:-
Your code should pass the following test cases.
Note that it may also be run against hidden test cases not shown here.

Input 1 :-
solution.solution(15324)
Output:-
  15129,169,25,1

Input 2 :-
solution.solution(12)
Output:-
  9,1,1,1
